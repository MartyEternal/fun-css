### CSS Tricks - List 001

Found a little follow-along tutorial to have darkened/shaded out list items show in a really cool way when hovering over them with your cursor.

I think this would be really well used in minimalist style websites. Instead of using brightness, you can use opacity or background color - essentially anything that allows the list item to fade into the background and not be seen until someone hovers over it.

This technique would allow for those who have difficulty focusing to not need to worry about sensory overload with heaps of information on the website. They would only need to see what they're actively trying to see.

Tip: Remember that the rotateY() doesn't take a string for its angle.
